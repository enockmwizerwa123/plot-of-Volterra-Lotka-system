# Plot-of-Volterra-Lotka-system
Here we are going to compare Runge Kutta Method and Euler's Method bu using Volterra Lotka system
The Euler method (also called forward Euler method) is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ordinary differential equations with a given initial value.When we change the initial conditions both the trajectory and plot for Euler's method tend to be smooth compared to the previous one i.e Euler's method is sensitive to the initial condition
Rungeâ€“Kutta method is an effective and widely used method for solving the initial-value problems of differential equations.In our case we can see that runge kutta method is the one which is giving accurate than euler method and also runge kutta method is the modiffication of euler method
